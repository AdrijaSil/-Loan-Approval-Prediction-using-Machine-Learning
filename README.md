# -Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Overview
This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved using machine learning. The model is trained on applicant data, including income, credit history, and loan amount, and can be deployed for automated loan approval decisions.

Features
Predicts loan approval based on applicant details.
Uses machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost.
Trained on a dataset of approved and rejected loan applications.
Can be deployed in real-time applications for financial institutions.
Dataset
The dataset consists of:

Approved and rejected loan applications.
Key features include:
Applicant details: Gender, marital status, education, self-employment.
Financial details: Applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history.
Loan details: Loan amount, loan term, property area.
Preprocessing steps:
Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Feature scaling for numerical attributes.
Model Architecture
Uses classification models for prediction.
Implemented with Scikit-Learn and XGBoost.
Feature selection to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Performance Metrics
The model is evaluated using:

Accuracy – Measures overall correctness.
Precision & Recall – Evaluates false approvals and rejections.
F1-Score – Balances precision and recall.
ROC-AUC Score – Assesses model performance across thresholds.
Future Improvements
Improve accuracy with more training data and feature engineering.
Optimize the model for real-time deployment in banking systems.
Develop a web-based loan approval system for financial institutions.
